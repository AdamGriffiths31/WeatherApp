# Weather App
 
This app uses an API from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather</a> to dispaly the weather for the current city. The user can add more cities via the input field or remove a city by clicking the trash icon. To add a city the API must return data - if not it is assumed to be an invalid input.

The app uses SQLite3 for the database layer, this stores the city names the user has inputted.
